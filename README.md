# Predicting and Comparing Prices of Heating Oil and Electricity in Maine

**Project description:** Final Project for ALY 6980 â€“ Capstone Project

### Background

This course was a practicum in executing a data analytics project for a sponsoring organization.  

### Project Description

For this project, my team worked for the Maine Governor's Energy Office (GEO).  The overall goal of the project was to analyze Maine's historic heating oil fuel prices and usage to provide context for Maine being the most heating oil dependent state in the nation.

### Individual Responsibility Within The Team

My role on the team was to generate predictions for heating oil and electricity prices, and compare these predicted prices for the next couple of heating seasons.

### Going Beyond the Coursework

While Holt-Winters exponential smoothing and basic moving averages were covered in the curriculum in another course, I used this project to learn and explore ARIMA and multivariate vector autoregressive (VAR) time series prediction models.
